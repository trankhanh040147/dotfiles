# Development Roadmap

## Design Principles & Coding Standards

> **Reference:** All design principles, coding standards, and implementation guidelines are defined in [`.cursor/rules/rules.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/rules.mdc).

### How To Apply These Rules

Automatically loads rules from the `.cursor/rules/` directory. The `rules.mdc` file includes `alwaysApply: true` in its frontmatter, which ensures:

- **Automatic Application:** Rules are always active during coding sessions
- **Context Awareness:** Understands project-specific patterns (Vim navigation, TUI-first UX, Go conventions)
- **Consistency:** All code suggestions follow the defined principles without manual reminders

## Bug Fix Protocol

1. **Global Fix:** Search codebase (`rg`/`fd`) for similar patterns/implementations. Fix **all** occurrences, not just the reported one.
2. **Documentation:**
    - Update "Known Bugs" table (Status: Fixed).
    - Update coding standards in `.cursor/rules/rules.mdc` if the bug reflects a common anti-pattern.
3. **Testing:** Verify edge cases: Interactive, Piped (`|`), Redirected (`<`), and Non-interactive modes.
> **Reference:** Bug Fix Protocol are defined in [`.cursor/rules/rules.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/rules.mdc).

## Philosophy

- Practice and revision are the best way to learn languages (Anki, SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm)
- Interactive CLI tool enables AI-powered tutoring with ELI5 explanations
- Users can customize prompts (presets) to adapt to their preferences
- Supports learning any language

## Core Features

- **Vocabulary:** Multi-faceted approach (typing, guessing, phrases, revision)
- **Reading:** Active engagement with real content (blogs/videos)
- **Writing:** Progressive difficulty (fill-in → rewrite → freeform conversation)

# v0.1.0 - Writing Tutor Mode

**Status:** Implemented ✓

**Scope:** Minimal changes - prompt templates and UI dialogs only. No database modifications.

**Features:**

- [x] **Session Flow:**
  - User opens command palette → "Select Mode" → mode selection dialog → topic input dialog (empty = random) → AI acts as Examiner
  - User answers in text, receives feedback after each response
- [x] **Feedback Engine:**
  - Immediate markdown feedback analyzing:
    - *Lexical Range:* Repeated words, C1 synonym suggestions
    - *Grammar:* Tense inconsistencies, errors
    - *Coherence:* Linking words, flow
  - Band score estimate per response (AI rates using rubric dimensions in prompt template)
- [x] **Stop-and-Fix:** AI prompts user to fix critical errors using current UI (no modal)
- [x] **End-of-Session:**
  - User types "end session" → AI generates session summary + Golden Phrases vocab list in markdown
- [ ] Open mode selection as command palette (ctrl+k)

**Implementation Details:**

| Component | File | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Prompt Template | `internal/agent/templates/writing-tutor.tpl` | IELTS rubric, feedback protocol, end-session vocab |
| Prompt Function | `internal/agent/prompts.go` | `WritingTutorPrompt(topic string)` |
| Mode Dialog | `internal/ui/dialog/modes.go` | Writing Tutor / Coder selection |
| Topic Dialog | `internal/ui/dialog/topic_input.go` | Text input, empty = random topic |
| Actions | `internal/ui/dialog/actions.go` | `ActionSelectMode`, `ActionTopicInput` |
| Coordinator | `internal/agent/coordinator.go` | Added `SetSystemPrompt()` to interface |
| UI Flow | `internal/ui/model/ui.go` | Mode state, dialog handlers, end-session detection |
| Commands | `internal/ui/dialog/commands.go` | "Select Mode" in command palette |

**User Flow:**
1. Open command palette (ctrl+k)
2. Select "Select Mode"
3. Choose "Writing Tutor"
4. Enter topic (or leave empty for random)
5. AI starts session as examiner
6. Type responses, receive feedback
7. Type "end session" to get summary + vocab list

**Known Limitations:**
- Mode state stored in UI only (not persisted to database)
- No keymap for end session (text command only)
- Coder mode in dialog just clears session (no special behavior)

**Deferred to v0.1.1:**

- **Database Schema:**
  - Add `mode` field to `sessions` table (e.g., "writing_tutor_ielts")
  - Add `metadata` JSON field to `sessions` for drill-specific data
  - Create `feedback` table for structured feedback storage (or extend `messages`)
  - Add `band_score` field to sessions/messages
  - Create `vocab_phrases` table (or store in session metadata)
- **Structured Feedback Format:**
  - Define JSON schema for machine-processable feedback
  - Sentence-level issue tracking (type, severity, position)
  - Store structured data vs. markdown-only
- **Session Metadata Tracking:**
  - Question type tracking (Part 1/2/3, Task 1/2)
  - Difficulty progression per session
  - Time tracking per question
- **UI Enhancements:**
  - Interactive vocab harvester: Bubbletea checklist dialog at end of session
  - Stop-and-Fix modal editor for sentence editing
  - Diff-style visualization for feedback
  - Session report file generation (`session_report_<date>.md`)
  - End session keymap (ctrl+e or similar)
- **Rubric Implementation:**
  - Move rubric dimensions from prompt to structured system
  - Calibration mechanism (reference essays, human-labeled examples)
  - Confidence intervals for band scores
  - Explicit rubric selection (IELTS Task 1/2, TOEFL, custom)
- **Session Persistence:**
  - Persist mode selection across sessions
  - Resume writing tutor sessions with context

# v0.2.0 - Writing Trainer Modes

**Status:** In Planning

**Features:**

### SOTA Writing Trainer Modes:
- [ ] **The "Refiner" (Diff View):** - User responds to a prompt → AI generates "Native Ideal" → TUI shows `git diff` style comparison (Red for errors, Green for improvements).
- [ ] **Semantic Validator:** - AI validates answers based on *meaning*, not string matching (allows for synonyms/variations).
- [ ] **Style Transfer:** - Drills focusing on register changes (Formal ↔ Casual).

#### A. The "Reverse Translation" Loop (The Interpolator)

Instead of asking the user to translate "Hello" -> "Hola", give them a target *context*.

1. **AI:** Presents a sentence in the User's Native Language (e.g., "I'm not sure if I can make it to the meeting.").
2. **User:** Attempts to write it in Target Language.
3. **AI Analysis:** Does not look for an exact string match. It evaluates **Semantic Equivalence**.
4. **Feedback:** If the meaning is close but the grammar is off, the AI highlights *only* the grammatical friction points.

#### B. "The Refiner" (Git Diff Learning)

This is the "Killer Feature" for a CLI tool.

1. **Prompt:** "Write a complaint about cold coffee."
2. **User Input:** "Coffee cold. I no like."
3. **AI SOTA Response:** It generates the "Native Speaker Version" ("The coffee is cold and I'm not happy about it.") and displays a **colored character-level Diff** between the user's input and the ideal output.
* *Why it works:* It's instant visual feedback on syntax and preposition usage.

#### C. "Style Transfer" Drills

1. **AI:** "Here is a formal sentence: 'I require assistance.' Rewrite this as if you are texting a close friend."
2. **User:** "Help me."
3. **AI:** Evaluates **Tone** and **Register**, not just grammar.
